To build on Linux you need to install the package libasound2-dev, and run `make` from the terminal in the folder Project/Builds/Linux.

To build on Windows, open the project found in Project/Builds/Visual Studio 2013.

The output will be a VST plugin (.so on Linux, .dll on Windows) that can be used in any modern DAW.
